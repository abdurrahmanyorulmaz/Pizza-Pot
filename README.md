# Pizza Pot
Pizza Pot is a pizza ordering system. It is designed for use in pizza restaurants. It includes user login-password, adding orders, viewing past orders, editing orders and deleting orders. In addition, there are user creation and deletions available for employees in the shop. This project was prepared in the second term of my university.
